	<h1 className="mt1 mt3-l mt3-m">Peoples General Woodhouse</h1>
	<p>The People‚Äôs General Woodhouse is a collective of woodworkers and other traders working in Sussex. We believe in:
		<ul className="pl0 ml0" style={{'list-style-type':'none'}}>
			<li className="pv1"><span role="img" aria-label="seedling">üå±</span> Eco-friendly building options</li>
			<li className="pv1"><span role="img" aria-label="love heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> Diversity and mutual aid in the trading community</li>
			<li className="pv1"><span role="img" aria-label="bank note">üí∑</span> Transparent pricing and respect for clients</li>
		</ul>
		All the timber we buy is FSC approved. We‚Äôll always consider how we can do the job in a more sustainable way. This could involve using recycled timber, biodegradable finishes, avoiding composite boards, etc.
		We want to see more women and people of diverse ethnicities and abilities to be involved in the trades. Our collective is a way for traders to share knowledge, tools, work and space for the benefit of everyone.
	We‚Äôll always give itemised quotes and strive to be flexible to meet people‚Äôs budgets. We‚Äôre respectful of the space when working in clients‚Äô homes and we‚Äôll always tidy up when the job is done. </p>
