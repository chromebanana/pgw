 		<p className="lh-copy">I was delighted with the work Alex has done for me, fixing my French windows onto the garden which involved replacing the hinges which weren't quite the right size which he corrected beautifully by trimming the wood, as well as restoring the very weather-damaged threshold. He took great care to find the best solution that would preserve the wood effectively. Alex is friendly and knowledgeable, and I wouldn't hesitate to employ his services again.</p>
