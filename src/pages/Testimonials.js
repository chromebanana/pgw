 		<p className="lh-copy">I was delighted with the work Alex has done for me, fixing my French windows onto the garden which involved replacing the hinges which weren't quite the right size which he corrected beautifully by trimming the wood, as well as restoring the very weather-damaged threshold. He took great care to find the best solution that would preserve the wood effectively. Alex is friendly and knowledgeable, and I wouldn't hesitate to employ his services again.</p>

       	<p>We had our two bed flat fully redecorated by Eloise and are extremely happy with the results. She was very tidy, punctual & polite. The finish is fantastic- especially the glossing. The price was very reasonable for the quality of the work and it was finished ahead of schedule which was a nice surprise!</p>
